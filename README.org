This is a presentation designed to provide a quick introduction to the
use of the Nix package manager.

It's an org-mode presentation.  The HTML version uses the [[https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js][reveal.js]]
package to make a nice slide presentation.  The output is generated
via the ox-reveal publishing package for org-mode, with the following
setup:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(use-package ox-reveal
 : ensure ox-reveal
 : config
 (progn
    (setq org-reveal-root "http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/reveal.js/3.0.0/")))
#+END_SRC

With this configuration, the HTML output can be generated when editing
the ~nixtalk.org~ source file by the key sequence: `C-c C-e R R` to
invoke org-export-dispatch and select the Reveal output, writing it to
a file.
